# 📘 What Am I Upto?

Welcome to **What Am I Upto?** — a fun repository where I dump my learning notes, experiments, and random tech explorations 🚀  

Think of it as my personal digital scratchpad 📝 — half guide, half playground.

## 💡 Why This Repo?

I wanted a place to:
- Track what I’m learning 🔍  
- Organize important commands & configs 🗂️  
- Share knowledge in case it helps someone else 🤝  
- Look back later and say “ahh, that’s how I learned it” 🕰️
